#Final project with Le Wagon.

An app that allows people to add their friends, create groups with their friends and then create events for their groups. You can then add external users specifically for that app. In the event page find details about location, date and description. Also find a map with a link to google maps, a chat feature for all attendees and the ability to add photos of the event. Once the event date is passed you can still view the event and see the photos.
